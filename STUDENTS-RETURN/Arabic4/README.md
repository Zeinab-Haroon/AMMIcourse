# Speech_recognition_project in Arabic Language
## Taught by Gabriel, Neil, Emmanuel and Laurent Besacier.

The project aims to build small Automatic Speech Recognition in high resource language (Arabic).
Linear layers were trained on top of pre-trained contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and it was fined tuned with connection temporal classification (CTC). As a result, the character error rate (CER) and the Phone error rate (PER) for both the train and test Dataset have been computed.

## Data Collection:
The Data contains two hours recording sets that were collected using LIG-Aikuma application in the Arabic Language. The recordings made in a mixture of standard and slang Arabic Language of various articles in Sudanese Culture, feminism, Short stories, News, history writing and novels. 
The Data has been split into a train (Wav files)- 40 mins, test- one hour and validation set in 20mins.
